## The MoCA assessment is a commonly used test in point of care scenarios. 
At MedHack, the use of this test was validated by the mentory responsible for the beginning presentation by StatsDoctor.

The test follows various tests across the categories of 'Visuospatial / Executive', 'Naming', 'Memory', 'Attention', 'Language', 'Abstraction', 'Delayed Recall', and 'Orientation'.

Relevant kinds of technologies which may be employed and things to watch for will be found in the relevant section of a jupyter notebook per test.
